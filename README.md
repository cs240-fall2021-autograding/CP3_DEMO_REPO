1. Clone this repo under student's "cs240-fall21-cp3-*" dir.

2. Run "bash DEMO_HELPER.sh"

3. "STUDENT_OUTPUT_DIR" will be generated for each grading column. 
   
   Compare it with correct outputs in "DESIRED_OUTPUT_DIR", together with the student.
   
   (I did not add "diff" to DEMO_HELPER.sh since some students were confused with the output.)

4. Refer to "TERMINAL_OUTPUTS.txt" to check student's terminal output for each grading-column.
